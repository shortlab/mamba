c  radical calculates concentrations of O2, H2, H2O2 and radicals in
c  coolant in a boiling water reactor (BWR) as a function of position 
c  along the flow path.  The code is based on species-balance equations
c  which consider such effects as:

c    Chemical reactions
c    Radiolysis (decomposition of H2O due to gamma and neutron radiation)
c    Convection
c    Mass transfer between liquid and gas (only for O2 and H2)
c    Thermal and surface decomposition of H2O2

c  A loop such as a bwr coolant loop is divided into a number of
c  components which are connencted through a combination of series 
c  and parallel flow paths.  Parameters for each component is
c  input through an input file which contains 3 major items:

c    1. Plant geometry (flow-path length, hydraulic diameter)
c    2. Plant operating condition (thermal-hydraulic data and radiation
c       level)
c    3. Water chemstry data (chemical reaction set, g-values, and
c       initial concentrations)

c  The code starts calculation at the first component and continues 
c  calculation along the flow path.  A component with, for instance,
c  radial gradient of radiation level such as the downcomer, may be 
c  subdivided into a number of parallel sub-components to increase 
c  accuracy of the output.

c  While the code is originally written for BWRs, its flexibility
c  allows the code to be adapted to many other problems, such as
c  PWRs, experimental loops, nuclear waste packages, or chemical
c  kinetics studies. 

c  A sensitivity analysis routine is also included in the code to get 
c  quantitative measure of how much input parameters, such as rate
c  constants and g-values, affect concentration output.  For example
c  the code can evaluate the sensitivity of H2O2 with respect to
c  rate constants, mass transfer coefficient, and g-values at each
c  component. This allows the user, or the experimenter, to concentrate
c  on those parameters that are particularly important.

c  This code relies on the subroutine 'DLSODE' to solve a system of
c  ordinary differential equations.  DLSODE is a powerful set of
c  routines for solving nonlinear, stiff, first-order ode's which has
c  been developed by Alan Hindmarsh at Lawrence Livermore National
c  Laboratory.  The author gratefully acknowledges the kind assistance
c  Dr. Hindmarsh has provided.

c  Modification Notes:

c  v1.0 Note: This is the first published version of radical after a
c  series of debugging and modification of MITIRAD 7.0.
c  MITIRAD 1.0 is a code package developed by Scott Simonson in 1988
c  at MIT as part of his PhD thesis. The code was used to assess
c  the radiation and chemistry effects on radioactive waste packages in
c  underground depository.
c  A major modification and addition to the code was carried out by
c  John Chun to include correct reaction equations and extend it to 
c  calculate multiple-component systems.
c  Routines for sensitivity analysis including adjoint and
c  response evaluator were rewritten and included in this 
c  version of radical.
c  Development stage for v1.0 (in reverse time)

c    0. Birth of radical 1.0 for MicroVax III.
c    1. Born again from MITIRAD version 7.0
c    2. Sensitivity analysis extension to MITIRAD version 6.0
c    3. Multiple-component extension to MITIRAD version 5.0
c    4. Two-phase flow extension (version MITIRAD 5.0)

c  v1.1 Note: This version is a result of transporting VAX Fortran to
c  MacFortran II. Some changes were necessary to run radical 1.0 on the
c  Macintosh using Absoft MacFortran II compiler and this version 1.1
c  reflects these changes.
c  No variable initialization is performed on MacFortran II so this was
c  performed explicitly in the code.
c  Date and Time subroutines are not supported on MacFortran II, so 
c  subroutines on a seperate file 'date.f' have been created.  These
c  subroutines may be machine dependent, so take caution.
c  A 1987 version of DLSODE is used instead of the 1981 version used in 
c  radical 1.0. No obvious differences have been noticed.
c  PlotFile has been modified to a columnar format for easier input
c  into KaleidaGraph.
c  SensFile of v1.0 has been removed completely. Sensitivity results
c  may still be plotted easily from the output file by the cut-&-paste method.
c  To cut a column at a time, use the Option-key select method in MS Word.

c  v1.11 Note: The exponent D in the output and plot file has been changed
c  to E for easier import to KaleidaGraph.  Also page breaks are removed.

c  v1.5 Note: All names, these include variables, constants, parameters
c  and subroutines, have been modified to conform to the Pascal
c  convention, ie, uppercase for the first letter of each word, for better
c  readability of the source code.  All FORTRAN reserved words are now in
c  lowercase.  All this means the code is case sensitive and may be
c  compiled without the folding option.
c  Some names have been chaned to make better sense,
c  eg. NeutCoef -> NeutCoef, GammaCoef -> GammaCoef, VoidCoef -> VoidCoef
c  Some minor bugs have been fixed, eg. the array boundary error for Koef
c  and the gas species in ppb.

c***********************************************************************

c  Compiler Notes:

c  v1.5 has been compiled using MacFORTRAN compiler version 3.2 and will
c  run on any Apple Macintosh computer with a math coprocessor and
c  System 6.0.5 or higher.  Minimum 2 mb RAM and 5 mb harddisk are needed.

c  MacFortran II Compiler v3.2 Notes:

c  Use the following compiler options to preserve VAX compatibilities.
c    -s  :this option preserves static storage of local variables.
c    -N8 :this auto-segmentation option removes memory-size related errors.
c    -f  :this option removes case-sensitivity by folding all characters.
c         Since all names in v1.5 have consistent case, this option
c         may be omitted depending on the platform.

c  MacFortran II Linker Note

c  Use the following linker options to preserve VAX compatibilities.
c    -f  :see above.

c     Called by radical
c     Calls ReadLoop, CheckInput, SetUpRx, SetUpNode, WriteLoop

c     Performs energy balance on a loop by fixing inlet enthalpy
c     at the component HeatBalComp.

c     How does it work?
c     DoHeatBalance calculates enthalpies for each component through
c     one complete cycle and compares the initial enthalpy at
c     NodeStart with the calculated value at the same node.
c     Any difference between the two values is due to energy imbalance.
c     This discrepancy is corrected at the component HeatBalComp,
c     thus ensuring energy conservation for the entire loop.

c     Heat balance can be done manually also by specifying inlet
c     temperature, carry under or carry over.

c
c	Calcuates the current due to a redox couple
c       Mode 0 returns the current density
c       Mode 1 returns the first derivative wrt. ECP
c       Anodic = 0 . discounts the anodic term in the denominator 
c	(this happens when the annodic limiting current is sufficiently greater)
